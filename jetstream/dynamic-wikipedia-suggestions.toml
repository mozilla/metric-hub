# On the treatment branch, most Wikipedia impressions will be from Dynamic Wikipedia.
# If Merino fails to provide a Dynamic result (eg. because of network issues),
# a user may see an offline expanded result instead.
# On the control branch, users should only ever see expanded Wikipedia results.
# Adding the 2 scalars together should count all Wikipedia impressions on both branches.
