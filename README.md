# metric-hub

Central hub for metric definitions that are considered the source of truth.
For more information on how to add metric definitions please see the [docs on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/metric_hub.html)

All metric definitions can be referenced in other tooling and their configurations, such as, [jetstream](https://github.com/mozilla/jetstream)
or [opmon](https://github.com/mozilla/opmon).

For adding jetstream specific configs or defaults, see the [jetstream-config](https://github.com/mozilla/jetstream-config) repo.
For adding OpMon specific configs or defaults, see the [opmon-config](https://github.com/mozilla/opmon-config) repo.
