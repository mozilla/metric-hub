# Defaults

This directory contains configurations for specific experiment types or platforms with default metrics and dimensions that are computed for every project. Configuration files in this directory need to be either named after the experiment type or the platform they target.

Changes to these configurations require approval on a pull request.

Avoid making changes to existing metrics, as results might become inconsistent with experiment analysis results computed in the past.
